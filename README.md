# DSJobHunting

Hi there! \
\
We all know that the job market is terrible this year, especially for new grads. As a new grad who finally landed a job after 10-month suffering, I'd like to share my experience on job hunting. I will also mention worth-noting companies in industries I am particularly interested in.\
\
Topics you can find here:
1. General strategies for job hunting as a new grad, especially those with data science backgrounds (like me!!!).
2. Quant Trading/Finance
3. Robotics
4. Pharmaceutical Industry
5. Travelling
6. AI Start-ups, especially LLM pioneers

\

I plan to update this repo at least once a week, and wrap up everything before late June.
